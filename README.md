# Connect 4 Agent

By: Curtis P. Hohl 👨‍💻

This program takes in a 2D array, representing the current state of a Connect 4 board. The application returns the number of the column to drop the next piece into. This progam was implemented using a variation of the MiniMax algorithm.

I developed this program for a competition in an Intelligent Systems course.
